# Movie Recommender System using Spacy
Uses the SpaCy library to build an advanced language model for movie recommendation. The model reads "movies.txt" and an input, then uses natural language processing techniques to compare strings and find the best match.

## Requirements
Requires the SpaCy library to be installed. To install SpaCy, run the following command in your command line interface:

pip install spacy

Requires the pre-trained English language model "en_core_web_md". You can download it using the following command:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

## Usage
To use this code, simply run the watch_next.py. It will read the "movies.txt" file and store the results in a dictionary. Then, it will call the recommender function, which takes a string parameter as input, compares it to the descriptions of the movies in the dictionary, and returns the movie title that has the highest similarity score.

The code includes an example where the movie description for "The Incredible Hulk" is used as the input parameter for the recommender function. The recommended movie title and its description are then printed to the console.

## File Format
The "movies.txt" file should be a plain text file with one movie title and its description per line, separated by a colon and a space (": "). For example:

The Shawshank Redemption: Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

## Functionality
This code is intended to be an example of how SpaCy can be used to build a movie recommender system. The recommender function is an example of how natural language processing techniques can be used to compare strings and find the best match.

This code is not intended to be a production-ready system and may require modifications to work with different types of data or to meet specific use cases.
